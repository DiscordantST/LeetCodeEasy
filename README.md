- Palindrome Linked List:

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

- Fizz Buzz:

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","F
